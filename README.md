# portfolio-page
## Description

Motivation for developing this project was to get a better base of my development in making a webpage.
I built this as way to show off projects that will come in the future. 
This helps me develope a template and guide for starting my coding journey from nothing. 
I learned I have a lot longer to go in developing tools and understanding.
